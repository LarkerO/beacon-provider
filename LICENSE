2. LIMITED GRANT OF RIGHTS TO PERMITTED PARTIES

   Subject to the restrictions in Section 3, the Copyright Holder hereby
   grants the Permitted Parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right to:

     a) use, run, and operate the Software;
     b) copy and modify the Software for internal use, development, testing,
        and project-related purposes;
     c) distribute and publish modifications and derivative works within the
        Hydroline Org and to the public from Hydroline-owned repositories,

        reasonably visible way;
     d) merge changes into repository branches and modify the project
        structure, features, or implementation ("project changes") for the

   These rights explicitly permit collaborative development within the

3. RESERVED RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS

   The following actions remain reserved and require explicit written permission
   from the Copyright Holder:

     a) assignment, sale, or transfer of the Copyright Holder's ownership
        or rights in the Software;
     b) relicensing the Software under any open-source license or granting

     c) commercial sale, sublicensing, or distribution of the Software or
        derivative works to third parties outside of the Hydroline Org,
